# AIM556: independent review of PR#83

**Attribution correction, 21 October 2026:** This submission has been replaced by [Esra Sengelen Sevim's earlier solution](../2026-10-21-yui-prior-art/556-prior-solution.md). The problem remains Solved; the manuscript links below now lead to the attribution note. The earlier acceptance account is historical and does not establish novelty.

Date:2026-10-13. [PR#83](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/83), Kaiwen Jin. Reviewed head:`73683304bcf7d3e748eb1c3f4db614175c938170`. Original target:`c9929805cece044705abaaebe1cebddac1ba11a6`, compared with the unchanged current statement.

**Decision: Solved.** Affirmative: the dimensional curse holds, with exponential deterministic sampling complexity for the full uniformly derivative-bounded class.

## Complete independent argument audit

The d-fold tensor U of the unit vector (cos((t-1/2)/2),sin((t-1/2)/2)) has derivative norm 2^(-|beta|). Product-rule multiplicities exactly cancel that factor in U^T Q U for an orthogonal projection Q, for every multi-index and arbitrarily high order. Positivity and the value bound are immediate. Choosing Q to annihilate the algorithm's zero-path sampled vectors removes a space of rank at most n. The integral covariance has trace one and norm lambda^d, lambda=1/2+sin(1/2)<1. Hence the integral is at least1-n lambda^d. Both signs give the same observations; this includes adaptive sampling and nonlinear output, without a positive-rule restriction. A second fresh audit reconstructed the same algebra.

All five references were checked: Krieg-Ullrich2602.02066v2, Wojtaszczyk0803.0441v1 (2003 publication,2008 upload), Novak-Pillichshammer2404.17163v1, Vybiral1909.11726 and Hinrichs-Krieg-Novak-Vybiral2004.00274v2. Their restricted cubature/rank-one results are accurately distinguished. The new lower bound is proved internally, without extrapolating a prior restricted theorem.

## Package and PDF evidence

The complete manuscript, target comparison, README, disclosures and ancillary content were inspected. All bibliography keys resolve; cited primary theorem hypotheses were compared with their actual uses. Original supplied file hashes were verified at the pinned revision. The source rebuilt successfully with shell execution disabled; text and every rendered page agree with the supplied PDF, without missing content, unresolved references or material clipping. Numerical diagnostics and structural checks do not by themselves certify a theorem.

The earlier advisory triage is superseded by this completed independent AI argument audit, including the primary-source, uniform-quantifier and reproduction checks above. No concrete unresolved proof step or omitted original target clause was identified. Solved follows CONTRIBUTING.md's documented-independent-audit criterion. No human peer review or Lean verification is asserted. Original problem pages and statements are retained.
