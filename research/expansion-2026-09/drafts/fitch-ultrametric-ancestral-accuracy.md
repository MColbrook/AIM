## Problem statement

Let $`r\ge5`$ be an integer and let $`T`$ be a finite rooted tree with at least two leaves, in which every internal vertex has exactly two children. Write $`\rho`$ for its root and $`X`$ for its leaf set. Assign each edge $`e`$ a finite length $`\ell_e\ge0`$, and require every path from $`\rho`$ to a leaf to have the same total length $`H`$. This is the molecular-clock, or ultrametric, assumption.

Generate states $`\sigma_v\in\{1,\ldots,r\}`$ on the vertices as follows. Choose $`\sigma_\rho`$ uniformly. Along an edge of length $`\ell`$, evolve a continuous-time Markov chain for time $`\ell`$ with generator

```math
Q_{ij}=\begin{cases}
-1,&i=j,\\
1/(r-1),&i\ne j.
\end{cases}
```

Branches evolve independently conditional on their parent states. This is the symmetric Neyman $`r`$-state model, with expected substitution rate one. In particular, the probability that any specified leaf has the root's state is

```math
q_r(H)=\frac1r+\frac{r-1}{r}\exp\!\left(-\frac{rH}{r-1}\right).
```

Observe the states at all leaves of the known tree. The Fitch parsimony estimator constructs a set $`S_v`$ at each vertex: $`S_x=\{\sigma_x\}`$ at a leaf, and, for children $`u,w`$ of an internal vertex $`v`$,

```math
S_v=\begin{cases}
S_u\cap S_w,&S_u\cap S_w\ne\varnothing,\\
S_u\cup S_w,&S_u\cap S_w=\varnothing.
\end{cases}
```

Choose $`\widehat\sigma_\rho`$ uniformly from $`S_\rho`$. Its accuracy includes both the random character generated on the tree and this final tie-breaking choice.

**Does every such tree and length assignment satisfy**

```math
\Pr\{\widehat\sigma_\rho=\sigma_\rho\}\ \ge\ q_r(H)?
```

Thus, does using all the leaves with Fitch parsimony perform at least as well as guessing the root state from any one leaf? This is the unresolved $`r>4`$ portion of the Li–Steel–Zhang conjecture. The same inequality is proved for $`r=2,3,4`$. The estimator uses the topology and leaf states; the edge lengths specify the probability model but are not inputs to its recursion. The question concerns one character on each finite tree, rather than an asymptotic sequence-length or tree-estimation guarantee.

## Applied significance

Ancestral-state inference estimates a trait or a sequence position of a common ancestor from present-day species. Parsimony provides a fast estimator without requiring branch-length estimates. The inequality would establish a basic accuracy guarantee for using an entire clock-like phylogeny with a larger character alphabet, including a stylized 20-state model for an amino-acid position. The symmetric model isolates the effect of tree shape and shared ancestry on information use. Actual protein substitutions have unequal rates, so the proposed guarantee would be a theoretical benchmark for that application, not a conclusion for arbitrary evolutionary models.

## Status review

Open in cited literature; no later resolution located as of 2026-09-18.

The September 18, 2026 search covered the conjecture's authors, Fitch/Neyman and molecular-clock terminology, general-state accuracy inequalities, proof and counterexample terms, 2025–2026 work, unrestricted dates, corrections and manuscript histories. Herbst–Fischer supplies a specialist assessment with authors disjoint from the original paper. Its publisher text was subscription-only; the relevant author-manuscript sections were read. The [evidence record](../candidates/fitch-ultrametric-ancestral-accuracy.json) records access and version differences and the full scope comparisons.

Herbst–Li–Steel proves the general bound $`\Pr\{\widehat\sigma_\rho=\sigma_\rho\}\ge1/r`$. For finite $`H`$, the requested $`q_r(H)`$ is larger. Its comparison with a recursive coin-toss estimator is proved for two states and conjectured for general $`r`$; Theorem 2 identifies the coin-toss benchmark with $`q_r(H)`$ under the clock assumption. Roch–Wang also treats two states, with a branching condition and an infinite-depth benchmark.

The non-clock counterexamples in Li–Steel–Zhang and Fischer–Thatte do not satisfy the equal-height hypothesis. Counterexamples to improvement over arbitrary subsets do not refute comparison with a single leaf. Other checked results concern prescribed leaf patterns, reconstruction of tree topology, or special tree shapes, rather than the asserted probability bound for all finite clock-like trees. No matching later resolution was located.

This is one problem across alphabet sizes. Unequal substitution rates, arbitrary subsets, and the stronger non-clock coin-toss conjecture are not separate additions. It differs from [selected-population genealogy](../../../problems/318-selected-brownian-population-genealogy.md), which asks for a random ancestry process, and [trace reconstruction](polynomial-trace-reconstruction.md), which asks how many deletion-channel observations identify an unknown string.

Review was a separated adversarial self-pass after drafting. No independent agent or human review is claimed.

A publication refresh on September 18, 2026 rechecked status and upstream duplicates; see the [batch 4 audit](../batch-04-review.md). No matching later resolution was located.
