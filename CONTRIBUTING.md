Suggestions, corrections and resolution reports are welcome through [issues](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/issues) or pull requests.

## Adding or revising a problem

Give a precise statement, primary references, and a dated search for later proofs or counterexamples. Explain its applications or mathematical significance; say when no direct application is known. Further additions exclude numerical linear algebra.

## Reporting a resolution

Include the problem ID and repository commit, a proof or counterexample link, and an explanation of how it matches the full target. Identify what was reviewed and by whom, including whether the review was human or AI.

For Lean work, follow the [setup and verification guide](docs/lean/README.md).
The shared [statement workspace](lean-statements/README.md) pins the same Lean,
Mathlib and LeanCert versions as OpenProblemsInNLA. Complete proof projects
live in `research/lean/<ID>/` and use the isolated Linux verification workflow.

## Status and evidence

Use the [status labels](README.md#problem-status), keeping the page badge and metadata consistent.

- **Partially resolved** entries need nonempty `**Known cases:**` and `**Remaining target:**` notes in **Status review**.
- A complete claim awaiting independent review is **Solution claimed**.
- **Solved** requires a published resolution or a documented independent audit of the complete argument.
- **Lean verified** requires a local `verification_record` linked from the page: pinned proof revision, Lean and dependency versions, theorem-to-target comparison, reproduction commands, a dated successful log, and transitive axiom output. Only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound` are acceptable; no `sorryAx` or unproved custom axioms.

Only `Open` and `Partially resolved` count as open targets. Mark a completed problem `Solved` in its existing page and `data/*.json` row, keeping its ID and linking to the proof and review; the generator includes it in the solved lists. Other retained statuses use `research/` and `catalogue.json`. Update `last_checked` only after an actual literature or evidence review.

Retained entries need a subject `group`; solved entries also need an `outcome` and direct `proof` and `review` links for the generated lists.

## Updating the catalogue

Problem pages need **Area**, **Status**, **Last checked**, and the sections **Problem statement**, **Application**, **References**, and **Status review**. Put the status badge before the first section. Use `math` fences for display equations and dollar-backtick delimiters for inline equations, with core TeX operators such as `\mathop{\mathrm{Per}}`.

Update the page and its `data/*.json` row. Add new IDs to a publication batch in `catalogue.json`; problem-page IDs must remain consecutive, including solved entries. Repair references when renumbering. Edit the generator for README or index wording.

```sh
python3 scripts/catalogue.py --write
python3 scripts/catalogue.py --check
```

The checks validate structure and links, not mathematical correctness. Run `python3 scripts/test_catalogue.py` when changing catalogue machinery.

Optional rendering QA: install `scripts/requirements-math.txt` and `mathjax-full@3.2.2`, set `NODE_PATH` to its `node_modules` directory, and run `python3 scripts/check_math.py`.
