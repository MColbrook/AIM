# 298. The Li–Li multiple-unicast conjecture

**Area:** Applied geometry, control and information

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Let $`G=(V,E)`$ be a finite connected undirected graph with capacities $`c_e\geq0`$. Specify finitely many sessions $`(s_i,t_i)`$, with $`s_i\ne t_i`$. Session $`i`$ has its own independent message, initially known at $`s_i`$, and requests its exact recovery at $`t_i`$.

Use noiseless links and causal network coding: each transmitted symbol may be any function of the sender's initial messages and previously received symbols. Both directions of an edge share its capacity. Define the zero-error throughput region $`\mathcal C_{\mathrm{NC}}`$ by arbitrary finite block protocols and asymptotic packet scaling: at scale $`b`$, messages have $`br_i`$ symbols and edge $`e`$ carries at most $`bc_e`$ symbols in total, with integer rounding and closure as $`b\to\infty`$. A common finite alphabet may be chosen for each protocol. There is no additional completion-time constraint.

For each session, let $`\mathcal P_i`$ be its set of simple source-to-destination paths. Its fractional routing region is

```math
\mathcal C_{\mathrm{MCF}}=
\left\{r\geq0:\ \exists x_{i,P}\geq0,\quad
\sum_{P\in\mathcal P_i}x_{i,P}\geq r_i\ \text{for all }i,\quad
\sum_i\sum_{\substack{P\in\mathcal P_i\\e\in P}}x_{i,P}\leq c_e\ \text{for all }e
\right\}.
```

Is $`\mathcal C_{\mathrm{NC}}=\mathcal C_{\mathrm{MCF}}`$ for every such graph, capacity assignment and session collection? Equivalently, can coding ever increase independent-unicast throughput over fractional routing? Coding need not be linear, and terminal locations may be shared across sessions. [1, 2, 5]

## Application

The question determines whether routers can increase sustained data-transfer rates by mixing independent streams instead of optimally splitting and forwarding packets. It connects the information-theoretic performance of a bidirectional communication network to a multicommodity-flow optimization problem. [1, 2]

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Solved on the basis of an **unverified announcement**. Section 4 claims a causal code on an undirected graph with 157 independent unicast sessions and shared edge capacities: common coding rate at least 1, whereas fractional routing has common rate at most 147/157. This is the throughput model in the original target; the separate nondeterministic construction in §3 is not the basis of this status.

[Claimed solution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2610.10108v1) · [Dated statement comparison](../research/solution-status-audit-2026-11-03/lane-b/298.json). §4, deterministic causal certificate and rate comparison. The full external proof has not been independently verified here; no local Lean kernel replay or human peer review is asserted. This label records the complete announcement under the requested status policy.

### Earlier status record


Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). Claim: negative

[Proof or source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2610.10108v1) · [Independent AI review](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-15-active-prs/170-source-scope-review_90_114.md). The linked review records the exact scope and verification limits; this is not human peer review or Lean verification.

**Review boundary:** Independent review of the complete external proof remains outstanding.

This AI-prepared report identifies a later resolution source or a direct application of an existing proof for maintainer review under the catalogue evidence policy.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-17)

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The August 2026 formulation [2] still treats the general conjecture as open. Its positive results restrict the terminal count, planar embedding, session pattern or number of coding nodes; its final reduction is conditional. Independent corroboration [3] explicitly distinguishes the unresolved unicast problem from its multicast separation. Multicast lets several destinations request the same message and is a different demand model.

The interaction framework [4] gives an equivalence and sufficient structural conditions, leaving universal independence of irreducible cores unproved. The completion-time separation [5] concerns finite packet demands; it does not establish an asymptotic throughput separation. The undecidability theorem [6] uses directed acyclic networks with general message demands and does not settle this undirected subclass. The equivalent transmission-cost formulation is included in this single entry.

The [evidence record](../research/expansion-2026-09/candidates/li-li-multiple-unicast.json) documents exact searches, source access, scope comparisons, duplicate screening and the separate adversarial self-review.

The September 17, 2026 review included named and mathematical formulations, author/citation searches, 2025–2026 results, and unrestricted proof, counterexample, resolution and correction searches; these were refreshed before integration.
