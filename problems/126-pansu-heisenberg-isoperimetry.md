# 126 — Pansu's isoperimetric conjecture in the Heisenberg group

**Area:** Sub-Riemannian geometric optimization

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

On $`\mathbb R^3`$ with coordinates $`(x,y,t)`$, put $`X=\partial_x-\frac y2\partial_t`$ and $`Y=\partial_y+\frac x2\partial_t`$. For a measurable set $`E`$ define horizontal perimeter by

```math
P_H(E)=\sup\left\{\int_E(Xa+Yb)\,dx\,dy\,dt:
a,b\in C_c^1(\mathbb R^3),\ a^2+b^2\le1\right\}.
```

For $`R>0`$ define the bubble

```math
B_R=\left\{x^2+y^2<R^2,\quad
|t|<\tfrac14\left(r\sqrt{R^2-r^2}+R^2\arccos(r/R)\right)\right\},
\qquad r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.
```

Does every measurable $`E`$ of finite positive Lebesgue volume and finite horizontal perimeter satisfy $`P_H(E)\ge P_H(B_R)`$ when $`|E|=|B_R|`$? This asks for global optimality among all finite-perimeter sets, without symmetry or boundary-regularity assumptions.

## Application

The Heisenberg geometry is a basic model of constrained motion. A sharp perimeter inequality quantifies the least boundary cost for a prescribed accessible volume and controls related diffusion inequalities.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Solved on the basis of an **unverified announcement**. The source claims sharp horizontal isoperimetry for every measurable finite-perimeter positive-finite-volume set, with no regularity or symmetry restriction. Its fields use t-normalization twice that of the local statement. The change(x,y,t)->(x,y,-2t) carries the local horizontal fields to the source fields and the displayed bubble to the source Pansu ball. Both volume and horizontal perimeter acquire factor2, so the equal-volume comparison is exactly preserved.

### Earlier status record


Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). Claim: affirmative sharp Heisenberg isoperimetry

[Proof or source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2610.07632v1) · [Independent AI review](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-15-active-prs/170-scope-review_141_169.md#aim-126). The linked review records the exact scope and verification limits; this is not human peer review or Lean verification.

**Review boundary:** The public source claims the full target. Its complete argument has not received an independent audit here, and a peer-reviewed published resolution was not established by this review; the source-to-target comparison alone is not full proof verification.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-08)

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The 2025 treatment explicitly distinguishes the conjectured sharp constant from established bounds. Results for symmetric sets or sufficiently regular candidate minimizers leave the unrestricted class above unresolved. Searches included “Pansu conjecture Heisenberg isoperimetric solved 2025 2026” and “Heisenberg bubble global finite perimeter minimizer”. No general resolution was located.
