# 366. Continuation of the cutoff Boltzmann flow from macroscopic bounds

**Area:** Rarefied gases; nonlinear kinetic transport

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-10-15

## Problem statement

Let $`f\ge0`$ be a smooth solution on $`[0,T)\times\mathbb T^3_x\times\mathbb R^3_v`$, $`T<\infty`$, of the hard-sphere cutoff equation

```math
\partial_tf+v\cdot\nabla_xf=\int_{\mathbb R^3}\int_{\mathbb S^2}|v-v_*|\,[f(v')f(v_*')-f(v)f(v_*)]\,d\sigma\,dv_*,
```

where $`v'=(v+v_*)/2+|v-v_*|\sigma/2`$ and $`v_*'=(v+v_*)/2-|v-v_*|\sigma/2`$; all factors share $`(t,x)`$. Assume $`f(0)`$ and all its derivatives decay faster than any inverse power of $`|v|`$. Suppose constants $`m_0,M_0,E_0>0`$ and $`H_0\in\mathbb R`$ satisfy, for all $`(t,x)`$,

```math
m_0\le\int f\,dv\le M_0,\qquad\int |v|^2f\,dv\le E_0,\qquad\int f\log f\,dv\le H_0.
```

Must $`f`$ extend beyond $`T`$ as a smooth solution with the same rapid velocity decay? No a priori bound on $`f`$ itself or on its derivatives is assumed.

## Application

The criterion would distinguish breakdown caused by concentration of observable gas density, energy or entropy from a loss of microscopic smoothness invisible to those quantities.

## Status review

Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #140](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/140). Counterexample to rapid-decay continuation in the explicitly stated broad class of jointly smooth solutions, using a positive inverse-sixth-power tail from Gaussian data.

**Scope:** The homogeneous nonnegative pointwise-smooth solution satisfies all original initial-Schwartz and uniform mass/energy/entropy hypotheses but cannot have a rapidly decaying endpoint extension. It already continues smoothly in a polynomially weighted class.

### Earlier review notes

The following historical notes are retained; the current decision and review date are given above.

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Checked on 22 September 2026 using cutoff Boltzmann continuation, hydrodynamic bounds, mass energy entropy and hard-sphere regularity. Silvestre explicitly proposes propagation of initial regularity under these assumptions for the cutoff equation. The 2025 pressure-and-moment conditional-regularity theorem concerns non-cutoff collisions and uses the regularizing angular singularity; it does not settle the hard-sphere cutoff problem. Global smooth results close to Maxwellians impose smallness. No matching large-data continuation criterion was located.
