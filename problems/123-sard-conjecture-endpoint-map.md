# 123 — Sard conjecture for smooth bracket-generating distributions

**Area:** Nonholonomic control / sub-Riemannian geometry

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Let $`M`$ be a smooth $`n`$-manifold and let smooth vector fields $`X_1,\ldots,X_r`$ span a constant-rank distribution $`\Delta\subset TM`$. Suppose their iterated Lie brackets span $`T_xM`$ at every $`x`$. For fixed $`x_0`$, define the endpoint map

```math
E_{x_0}:u\longmapsto x_u(1),\qquad
\dot x_u(t)=\sum_{j=1}^r u_j(t)X_j(x_u(t)),\quad x_u(0)=x_0,
```

on the open subset of $`L^2([0,1];\mathbb R^r)`$ for which the trajectory exists. Call a control singular when the differential $`DE_{x_0}(u)`$ is not onto $`T_{E_{x_0}(u)}M`$.

Is the set of endpoints of all singular controls null for every smooth positive volume density on $`M`$, for every such distribution and every $`x_0`$?

## Application

Singular trajectories are the exceptional motions that evade ordinary first-order controllability tests in systems with nonholonomic constraints. The conjecture says their destinations occupy no volume.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Counterexample. The smooth rank-two bracket-generating distribution on R4 has abnormal endpoints equal to R4 from one basepoint; a global frame gives the same L2 control endpoint map. Constant distribution rank is maintained; the local target does not require equiregularity or analyticity. Full endpoint set is not volume-null. Minimizing Sard property is different and is not claimed refuted.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-08)

**Known cases:** The null-endpoint conclusion is established for rank-three distributions in dimension four and for the cited generic corank-one class.

**Remaining target:** The null-endpoint conclusion for every smooth bracket-generating distribution in the displayed class.

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The 2025 paper proves the result for rank-three distributions in dimension four and for generic corank-one distributions, while retaining the general smooth conjecture. Searches included “Sard conjecture smooth distributions solution 2025 2026” and “analytic minimal rank Sard conjecture 2026”. Analytic, minimal-rank and generic-distribution theorems have narrower quantifiers than the statement above.
