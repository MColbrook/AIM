# 394. Villani’s convex-injectivity-domain conjecture

**Area:** Optimal transport / Riemannian geometry

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Let $`(M,g)`$ be a smooth compact connected Riemannian manifold without boundary. Write

```math
I_x=\{v\in T_xM:\exists t>1\text{ with }d(x,\exp_x(tv))=t|v|_g\}.
```

For $`v\in I_x`$ and $`\xi,\eta\in T_xM`$, define

```math
S_{x,v}(\xi,\eta)=-\frac32\left.\partial_s^2\partial_t^2\frac{d^2(\exp_x(t\xi),\exp_x(v+s\eta))}{2}\right|_{s=t=0}.
```

Assume $`S_{x,v}(\xi,\eta)\ge0`$ whenever $`\langle\xi,\eta\rangle_g=0`$; this is the weak Ma–Trudinger–Wang condition. Must $`I_x`$ be convex for every $`x\in M`$? No hypothesis excluding focal points on the cut locus is imposed.

## Application

Injectivity-domain convexity is a geometric prerequisite for continuous transport maps. It links the nonlinear PDE used to redistribute mass on curved surfaces and manifolds to the underlying geometry.

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Solved on the basis of an **unverified announcement**. Affirmative convexity under weak MTW with focal cut points allowed.

Source locator: §1.1 equations(1.1)–(1.3), Theorem1.1, printedp2. The comparison records the hypotheses, quantifiers and any reduction to the original target. The full external proof has not been independently verified here; no new Lean kernel replay, certificate replay or human peer review is asserted.

Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). Claim: affirmative convex injectivity domains under weak MTW

[Proof or source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/math/fd4aeeb2ee4fc729c18d98444fed42fd0529eeeb/preprints/Global-Support-and-Convex-Injectivity-Domains-under-Weak-MTW-September-25-2026/paper.pdf) · [Independent AI review](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-15-active-prs/170-scope-review_141_169.md#aim-394). The linked review records the exact scope and verification limits; this is not human peer review or Lean verification.

**Review boundary:** The public source claims the full target. Its complete argument has not received an independent audit here, and a peer-reviewed published resolution was not established by this review; the source-to-target comparison alone is not full proof verification.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-22)

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The SIAM theorem proves the conclusion under the additional nonfocal assumption; the 2022 survey retains the general statement as a conjecture. Searches through 22 September 2026 included Villani MTW convexity, injectivity domains, focal cut loci, and the authors’ later work. Special manifolds and stability results for already regular transport do not resolve the unrestricted implication.
