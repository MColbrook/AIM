# 216. Boundary-flux commutators for rough conductors

**Area:** Boundary operators / heterogeneous conduction

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-10-15

## Problem statement

Let $`\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d`$, $`d\ge2`$, be bounded, connected and Lipschitz. Let $`C\in L^\infty(\Omega;\mathbb R^{d\times d})`$ be symmetric, with $`\mu I\le C(x)\le\mu^{-1}I`$ almost everywhere for some $`\mu>0`$.
For $`\varphi\in H^{1/2}(\partial\Omega)`$ let $`u_\varphi\in H^1(\Omega)`$ be its weak $`C`$-harmonic extension. Define $`\varphi\in D(N)`$ and $`N\varphi=h\in L^2(\partial\Omega)`$ by

```math
\int_\Omega C\nabla u_\varphi\cdot\overline{\nabla v}
=\int_{\partial\Omega}h\,\overline{\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}\nolimits v}\,dS
\quad(v\in H^1(\Omega)).
```

For every $`g\in C^\infty(\mathbb R^d)`$, is there $`K<\infty`$ such that

```math
g\varphi\in D(N),\qquad
\|N(g\varphi)-gN\varphi\|_{L^2(\partial\Omega)}
\le K\|\varphi\|_{L^2(\partial\Omega)}
\quad(\varphi\in D(N))?
```

Here $`g`$ on the boundary means its restriction, and $`K`$ may depend on $`\Omega,C,g`$.

## Application

The operator maps an imposed boundary potential to outward current. The estimate controls how smoothly localizing a boundary voltage interacts with measuring flux through a conductor containing unresolved spatial heterogeneity.

## Status review

Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). A measurable-conductor counterexample to smooth multiplier invariance of the flux domain.

[Proof or source](https://www.numdam.org/article/ASNSP_1963_3_17_3_189_0.pdf) · [Independent AI review](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-15-active-prs/170-source-scope-root.md). The linked review records the target comparison.

**Scope:** The half-disk Meyers example has a smooth boundary multiplier whose harmonic extension has conormal flux outside L2.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-13)

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The stated question drops Hölder continuity but retains symmetry and real coefficients. Half-space results impose additional structure, including independence from the normal coordinate, and do not cover arbitrary bounded Lipschitz domains and arbitrary measurable $`C(x)`$.

**Search audit:** Searched “Dirichlet to Neumann commutator bounded measurable coefficients 2026”, “rough coefficient Lipschitz domain commutator Shen”, and follow-ups to the 2025 Question 2. Searches included later proofs, counterexamples, and 2025–2026 updates. No resolution matching the stated hypotheses was located.
