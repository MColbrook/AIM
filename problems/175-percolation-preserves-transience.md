# 175. Does supercritical percolation preserve transience?

**Area:** Diffusion in diluted networks

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Let $`G`$ be the Cayley graph of an infinite finitely generated group with a finite symmetric generating set. Assume simple random walk on $`G`$ is transient. For $`p>p_c(G)`$ retain each edge independently with probability $`p`$, where $`p_c(G)`$ is the infimum of parameters giving an infinite open component with positive probability. Must simple random walk on every infinite open component be transient, almost surely? Transience means that a walk starting at any vertex returns to it only finitely often almost surely.

## Application

Random deletion of conducting bonds can create trapping and bottlenecks. The question asks whether dilution above the connectivity threshold can change long-time diffusion from transient to recurrent.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Solved on the basis of an **unverified announcement**. Corollary1.1 claims that all infinite clusters are transient almost surely for p>pc on every infinite connected locally finite transient transitive graph. A Cayley graph with finite symmetric generators is in this class. The result has no polynomial-growth or amenability restriction; the excluded critical parameter p=pc is not part of the local target.

Source locator: Corollary1.1, displayed assertion(1). The complete external proof has not been independently verified here; no new Lean kernel replay, certificate replay or human peer review is asserted. This status records a complete matching claim under the requested policy.

### Earlier status record


Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). Claim: affirmative

[Proof or source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2603.03257v1) · [Independent AI review](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-15-active-prs/170-source-scope-review_90_114.md). The linked review records the exact scope and verification limits; this is not human peer review or Lean verification.

**Review boundary:** Independent review of the complete external proof remains outstanding.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-08)

**Known cases:** Supercritical percolation preserves transience on Euclidean lattices in transient dimensions and on the cited nonamenable classes.

**Remaining target:** Preservation of transience on every transient Cayley graph at every strictly supercritical parameter.

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The updated book retains the conjecture. It is known for Euclidean lattices in transient dimensions and for important nonamenable classes; those results do not cover all transient Cayley graphs. This entry restricts to strictly supercritical parameters and does not assert anything at criticality.

Search topics checked on 2026-09-08: `percolation transience Cayley conjecture 2025 2026; percolation preserves transience solved`. No later resolution of the exact statement was located; this is not a certification that no proof exists.
