# 092. The dimension-free Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits inequality

**Area:** High-dimensional probability and sampling

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Does there exist a universal constant $`C<\infty`$ such that, for every $`n\ge1`$, every probability density $`e^{-V}`$ on $`\mathbb R^n`$ with convex extended-real $`V`$, mean zero and covariance $`I_n`$, and every smooth compactly supported $`f:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R`$,

```math
\mathop{\mathrm{Var}}\nolimits_\mu(f)
:=\int f^2\,d\mu-\left(\int f\,d\mu\right)^2
\le C\int|\nabla f|^2\,d\mu?
```

Extended-real convex potentials include uniform measures on convex bodies. The same $`C`$ must work in all dimensions and for all such densities and functions. This is the Poincaré formulation of KLS.

## Application

A dimension-free spectral gap would strengthen guarantees for sampling log-concave distributions and for concentration in high-dimensional inference.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Solved on the basis of an **unverified announcement**. The current theorem bounds CP(mu) by one absolute constant for every dimension and isotropic log-concave measure, including extended-real convex potentials and uniform convex-body measures. Its locally-Lipschitz L2 class contains every local smooth compactly supported test. No subgaussian assumption remains. A current Palomar registration separately advertises the same compact-test target; local Lean replay is not asserted.

The complete external proof has not been independently verified here; no new Lean kernel replay, certificate replay or human peer review is asserted. This status records a complete matching claim under the requested policy.

### Earlier status record


Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). Claim: affirmative dimension-free Poincare inequality

[Proof or source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2610.05474v1) · [Independent AI review](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-15-active-prs/170-scope-review_141_169.md#aim-092). The linked review records the exact scope and verification limits; this is not human peer review or Lean verification.

**Review boundary:** The public source claims the full target. Its complete argument has not received an independent audit here, and a peer-reviewed published resolution was not established by this review; the source-to-target comparison alone is not full proof verification.

### Earlier status review (2026-10-13)

**Known cases:** A dimension-free logarithmic Sobolev bound gives the required Poincare bound for isotropic log-concave measures with an absolute bound on their linear subgaussian parameter.

**Remaining target:** Obtain a universal bound for arbitrary isotropic log-concave measures without the additional subgaussian restriction.

**Statement comparison:** A dimension-free LSI implies a Poincare bound by linearizing the entropy inequality at a constant. It gives AIM for isotropic log-concave densities whose linear subgaussian parameter a is bounded by a fixed absolute constant; uniform convex-body densities are allowed. General isotropic log-concave measures may have only exponential tails, so the subgaussian assumption is a genuine restriction and cannot be discarded.

**Review scope:** The [dated source comparison](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-13-openai-crosscheck/README.md#aim-092) checked the actual theorem, hypotheses, quantifiers and required reductions against the unchanged AIM statement. This is an AI statement-level review of a published manuscript, not a fresh independent audit of its complete proof or a Lean kernel replay.

**Lean scope:** No corresponding complete Lean development was identified in the linked family record; no Lean-verified status is asserted.
