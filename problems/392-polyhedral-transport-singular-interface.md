# 392. Regularity of transport interfaces for nonconvex polyhedral targets

**Area:** Monge–Ampère PDEs / optimal transport

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Let $`n\ge3`$, let $`\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n`$ be a bounded domain, and let $`\Omega^*`$ be a bounded nonconvex polyhedral domain of the same volume. Here polyhedral means that its boundary is a finite union of flat polygonal facets. Let $`u`$ be a convex Brenier potential satisfying $`(\nabla u)_\#\mathbf1_\Omega=\mathbf1_{\Omega^*}`$, and set

```math
A=\{x\in\Omega:u\text{ is not differentiable at }x\},\qquad \Sigma=\overline A\cap\Omega.
```

Is there a relatively closed $`S\subset\Sigma`$ with $`\dim_H S\le n-2`$ such that $`\Sigma\setminus S`$ is locally a smooth embedded hypersurface? The empty singular set is allowed.

## Application

Optimal transport to complex polyhedral geometries underlies mesh generation and mass allocation. The conjecture predicts that discontinuities concentrate along smooth interfaces with only lower-dimensional junctions.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-22)

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Conjecture 5.1 is posed after the authors prove the planar polygonal case. The 2025 Inventiones theorem treats a target made of two disjoint convex domains, not a general nonconvex polyhedral target. Searches through 22 September 2026 for higher-dimensional polyhedral transport interfaces and later versions of both papers located no proof or counterexample. This concerns the structure of the full-transport singular set, rather than the free boundary in partial transport.
