# 030. SIC measurements in every finite dimension

**Area:** Quantum measurement and frame theory

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

For every integer $`d\ge2`$, do there exist $`d^2`$ unit vectors $`\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_{d^2}\in\mathbb C^d`$ such that

```math
|\langle\psi_j,\psi_k\rangle|^2=\frac1{d+1}\quad(j\ne k)?
```

Such a family is a symmetric informationally complete set. The measurement effects $`E_j=d^{-1}\psi_j\psi_j^*`$ then satisfy $`\sum_jE_j=I_d`$. No group-covariance assumption is imposed.

## Application

A SIC gives a minimal, highly symmetric informationally complete measurement for reconstructing a quantum state. It is also a maximal equiangular line configuration and an optimal finite frame for several estimation criteria.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Affirmative proof. The paper combines its unconditional unitary-conjugate theorem with RW26 Theorem7 and AFK25 Theorem1.46 to assert M^2 complex equiangular lines in C^M for every M>=4. The known d2/3 constructions complete the target. Maximal complex equiangular families are SICs; no covariance assumption or unresolved Stark hypothesis remains in this conclusion.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-08)

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located

Checked on **2026-09-08**. Appleby–Flammia–Kopp explicitly require two number-theoretic/special-value conjectures for their all-dimension construction. The 2026 certification work continues to treat general SIC existence as conjectural. Neither numerical examples in many dimensions nor a conditional formula prove the universal assertion.

Searches included: `SIC POVM all dimensions 2026 conjecture`; `Zauner conjecture solved 2026`; `Constructive Approach Zauner Stark conjectures`. This is a documented literature check, not a certification that no solution exists.
