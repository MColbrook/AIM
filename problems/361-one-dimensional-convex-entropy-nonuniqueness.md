# 361. Can one-dimensional entropy-dissipating systems have two bounded solutions?

**Area:** Continuum mechanics; admissibility of shock dynamics

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Do there exist an integer $`N\ge2`$, an open convex state set $`U\subset\mathbb R^N`$, a smooth flux $`f:U\to\mathbb R^N`$ with $`Df(u)`$ having $`N`$ distinct real eigenvalues for every $`u\in U`$, and a smooth entropy pair $`(\eta,q)`$ satisfying

```math
D^2\eta(u)>0,\qquad Dq(u)=D\eta(u)Df(u),
```

together with $`T>0`$ and bounded measurable initial data $`u_0`$, for which two distinct bounded distributional solutions $`u,v:(0,T)\times\mathbb R\to K\Subset U`$ satisfy

```math
w_t+f(w)_x=0,\qquad \partial_t\eta(w)+\partial_xq(w)\le0\quad(w=u,v),
```

and both attain $`u_0`$ strongly in $`L^1_{\rm loc}`$ at $`t=0`$? Distinct means that they differ on a set of positive spacetime measure. The displayed entropy inequality must hold throughout spacetime, rather than only at jump discontinuities; no bounded-variation hypothesis is imposed.

## Application

An entropy inequality encodes the second law or energy dissipation in continuum models. This problem tests whether that physical criterion by itself can fail to select a unique one-dimensional evolution when arbitrarily fine oscillations are allowed.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Solved on the basis of an **unverified announcement**. Affirmative existence of two bounded entropy-admissible solutions.

[Claimed solution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2609.09353v1) · [Dated statement comparison](../research/solution-status-audit-2026-11-03/lane-b/361.json). Source locator: Theorem1.3; §1.4 p-system and entropy; §9 Steps1–3 and wedge gluing. The comparison records the hypotheses, quantifiers and any reduction to the original target. The full external proof has not been independently verified here; no new Lean kernel replay, certificate replay or human peer review is asserted.

### Earlier status record


Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). Claim: affirmative existence, claimed

**Review boundary:** Independent review of the complete external proof remains outstanding.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-22)

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Checked on 22 September 2026 using one-dimensional nonuniqueness with strictly convex entropy, $`p`$-system convex integration, and Bressan's Open Problem 6. Krupa's 2026 paper obtains nonuniqueness satisfying jump-based Liu admissibility, but explicitly states that its construction does not satisfy the required convex entropy condition. Multidimensional compressible Euler counterexamples use additional spatial dimensions. The small-BV uniqueness theorem does not apply to arbitrary bounded solutions. No matching one-dimensional entropy-admissible example was located.
