# 108. Uniqueness of the critical catenoid

**Area:** Capillary surfaces and spectral geometry

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Let $`\Sigma\subset\overline{B^3}`$ be a smooth compact connected properly embedded minimal annulus, with its interior in $`B^3`$ and its boundary in $`S^2`$, meeting $`S^2`$ orthogonally. Prove or disprove that a rotation carries $`\Sigma`$ onto the critical catenoid

```math
X(t,\theta)=a(\cosh t\cos\theta,\cosh t\sin\theta,t),\quad |t|\le t_0,\quad\theta\in\mathbb R/(2\pi\mathbb Z),
```

where $`t_0>0`$ solves $`t_0\tanh t_0=1`$ and $`a=(\cosh^2t_0+t_0^2)^{-1/2}`$.

## Application

This class models zero-mean-curvature capillary films attached at a right angle to a spherical container. Classification would determine whether a second embedded annular equilibrium geometry is possible.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Solved on the basis of an **unverified announcement**. The announced Corollary1.2 gives uniqueness up to rotation of every properly embedded free-boundary minimal annulus in the unit3-ball. Local hypotheses impose exactly smoothness, proper embedding, annular topology and orthogonal boundary meeting; no extra reflection symmetry is required. The standard critical-catenoid parametrization is the same object.

The complete external proof has not been independently verified here; no new Lean kernel replay, certificate replay or human peer review is asserted. This status records a complete matching claim under the requested policy.

### Earlier status record


Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). Claim: affirmative uniqueness of the critical catenoid

[Proof or source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2609.13054v1) · [Independent AI review](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-15-active-prs/170-scope-review_141_169.md#aim-108). The linked review records the exact scope and verification limits; this is not human peer review or Lean verification.

**Review boundary:** The public source claims the full target. Its complete argument has not received an independent audit here, and a peer-reviewed published resolution was not established by this review; the source-to-target comparison alone is not full proof verification.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-08)

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Symmetry assumptions and the support-function condition in the 2023 paper yield uniqueness in subclasses. The August 2026 paper treats annulus existence and min–max characterization; it does not classify every embedded free-boundary minimal annulus in the Euclidean ball. No unrestricted uniqueness proof was located.

**Search audit:** “critical catenoid conjecture uniqueness embedded annulus 2025 2026”; “free boundary minimal annuli convex balls”. Searches included proof, counterexample, and 2025–2026 updates. No later resolution of the stated problem was located; this is a literature review, not a proof of openness.
