# 214. Optimal spectral signings of regular graphs

**Area:** Spectral graph theory / network design

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

For an integer $`d\ge2`$, let $`G=(V,E)`$ be any finite simple undirected $`d`$-regular graph. A signing is a map $`s:E\to\{-1,1\}`$. Its signed adjacency matrix is the real symmetric matrix

```math
(A_s)_{uv}=\begin{cases}s(\{u,v\}),&\{u,v\}\in E,\\0,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}
```

Does every such graph admit a signing for which every eigenvalue $`\lambda`$ of $`A_s`$ satisfies

```math
|\lambda|\le2\sqrt{d-1}?
```

Both ends of the spectrum must satisfy the bound.

## Application

A signing defines a two-sheeted graph lift: positive edges stay in the same sheet and negative edges cross sheets. This conjecture would let network designers double a regular network while controlling all newly introduced spectral modes at the optimal universal-cover threshold.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Solved on the basis of an **unverified announcement**. The finite connected simple cubic graph F in Theorem1.1 has signed adjacency norm>2sqrt2 for every edge signing. That disproves the universal two-sided bound at d3. Its failure to be a Ramanujan base graph does not weaken this counterexample because the local statement does not assume that restriction. A one-sided signing theorem would not suffice.

The complete external proof has not been independently verified here; no new Lean kernel replay, certificate replay or human peer review is asserted. This status records a complete matching claim under the requested policy.

### Earlier status record


Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). Claim: negative

**Review boundary:** Independent review of the complete external proof remains outstanding.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-13)

**Known cases:** The optimal two-sided spectral signing bound is established for bipartite regular graphs.

**Remaining target:** The same optimal two-sided bound for every finite simple regular graph.

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The bipartite case is known, because a one-sided signing bound then controls both spectral ends. The June 2026 general result gives $`2\sqrt{3(d-1)}`$, which leaves the requested constant unresolved. The July preprint imposes structural hypotheses and allows an error factor; its companion result on specific circulants does not cover all regular graphs.

**Search audit:** Searched “Bilu Linial conjecture solved proof signing 2026”, “two-sided Ramanujan signings”, and June–September 2026 follow-ups, including arXiv:2607.17343 and arXiv:2607.18334. Searches included later proofs, counterexamples, and 2025–2026 updates. No resolution matching the stated hypotheses was located.
