# 390. Sharp weak integrability of planar Monge–Ampère Hessians

**Area:** Nonlinear elliptic PDEs / optimal transport

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-10-15

## Problem statement

Let $`0<\lambda<1`$, let $`\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2`$ be bounded and convex, and let $`u`$ be a convex Alexandrov solution with

```math
\lambda\le\det D^2u\le\lambda^{-1}\quad\text{in }\Omega.
```

Here the inequalities mean $`\lambda|E|\le|\partial u(E)|\le\lambda^{-1}|E|`$ for every Borel $`E\subset\Omega`$. Is the distributional Hessian represented by a matrix field satisfying, for every $`\Omega'\Subset\Omega`$,

```math
\sup_{s>0}s^{p_\lambda}\bigl|\{x\in\Omega':|D^2u(x)|>s\}\bigr|<\infty,\qquad p_\lambda=\frac{1+\lambda^2}{1-\lambda^2}?
```

This is the conjectured endpoint weak-$`L^{p_\lambda}`$ estimate, not merely integrability with some unspecified exponent larger than one.

## Application

Hessian bounds control distortion and sensitivity of transport maps used in mesh adaptation and mass redistribution. The conjecture identifies how sharply that distortion can concentrate when only density ratios are controlled.

## Status review

Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #134](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/134). Local strong Hessian integrability at the requested exponent for the full planar Alexandrov class, implying the weak endpoint estimate.

**Scope:** Original-class coordinate/area identities and a local weighted scalar-projection defect estimate establish the endpoint for every parameter and compact interior set.

### Earlier review notes

The following historical notes are retained; the current decision and review date are given above.

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The survey explicitly proposes this exponent using planar quasiconformal theory. Searches through 22 September 2026 covered sharp planar Hessian integrability, the stated exponent, and subsequent work by De Philippis, Figalli, Savin and Mooney. Higher integrability with a non-sharp positive epsilon is established; the upper-bound-only degenerate problem has counterexamples, but those remove the positive lower bound essential here. No endpoint resolution was located.
