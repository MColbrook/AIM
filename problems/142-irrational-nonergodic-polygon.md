# 142 — An irrational polygon with nonergodic billiard flow

**Area:** Billiard dynamics / transport and ergodicity

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-10-15

## Problem statement

Does there exist a bounded simple polygon $`P\subset\mathbb R^2`$, with at least one interior angle an irrational multiple of $`\pi`$, whose unit-speed specular billiard flow is not ergodic?

More precisely, equip $`P\times S^1`$ with normalized Liouville measure

```math
d\mu=\frac{dx\,dy\,d\theta}{2\pi\,\mathop{\mathrm{Area}}\nolimits(P)}.
```

Straight motion inside $`P`$ is reflected at each side by equal incidence and reflection angles. Ignore the null set of trajectories hitting vertices. The requested example must have a measurable set $`A`$ invariant under this flow with $`0<\mu(A)<1`$.

The whole unit tangent bundle is used, rather than a single directional component of a rational-polygon unfolding.

## Application

Polygonal billiards model collision transport without curved focusing or dispersing walls. A counterexample would identify a mechanism preventing global mixing even when the reflection angles generate infinitely many directions.

## Status review

Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). No irrational simple polygon with nonergodic full billiard flow, by the zero-frequency proof extension.

[Proof or source](https://github.com/openai/math/blob/1581d4cbdd69a0faf34b2089614fe2a814316a6a/preprints/Weak-mixing-of-triangular-billiards-with-an-irrational-angle-October-5-2026/weak-mixing-triangular-billiards.pdf) · [Independent AI review](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-15-active-prs/142-independent-zero-frequency-review.md). The linked review records the target comparison.

**Scope:** The invariant-function argument uses only finitely many flat cone tips, and adjacent irrational reflections force the position-independent angular function constant.

### Earlier status review (2026-10-13)

**Known cases:** Every irrational-angle Euclidean triangle is weakly mixing, hence ergodic, for the specified Liouville billiard measure. This rules out a nonergodic example with three sides.

**Remaining target:** Decide whether an irrational polygon with four or more sides can be nonergodic, or rule out all such examples.

**Statement comparison:** The weak-mixing theorem applies to every nondegenerate irrational-angle Euclidean triangle under precisely normalized position-times-uniform-direction Liouville measure, excluding the same null vertex-hit trajectories. Weak mixing implies ergodicity, so every three-side instance of the requested irrational polygon example is impossible; the existential question for larger polygons remains open.

**Review scope:** The [dated source comparison](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-13-openai-crosscheck/README.md#aim-142) checked the actual theorem, hypotheses, quantifiers and required reductions against the unchanged AIM statement. This is an AI statement-level review of a published manuscript, not a fresh independent audit of its complete proof or a Lean kernel replay.

**Lean scope:** [Upstream scope 1](https://github.com/openai/math/blob/1581d4cbdd69a0faf34b2089614fe2a814316a6a/lean/docs/150.md). Family150 selected Lean docs formalize ergodicity of irrational triangles, which suffices for this partial exclusion; weak mixing is not the selected comparator claim. Comparator presence is not local verification. No AIM Lean-verified status is asserted.
