# 110. Linear growth of interior Steklov nodal volume

**Area:** Boundary-driven wave patterns

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Let $`(M,g)`$ be any smooth compact connected $`d`$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with smooth nonempty boundary, $`d\ge2`$. For a real nonzero Steklov eigenfunction

```math
\Delta_g u=0\text{ in }M,\qquad\partial_\nu u=\sigma u\text{ on }\partial M,\qquad\sigma>0,
```

write $`Z_u=\{x\in\mathop{\mathrm{int}}\nolimits M:u(x)=0\}`$. Prove or disprove that there are constants $`0<c_M\le C_M<\infty`$, independent of $`u`$ and $`\sigma`$, such that

```math
c_M\sigma\le\mathcal H^{d-1}_g(Z_u)\le C_M\sigma.
```

Only the nodal set inside the medium is counted; the boundary trace has a different-dimensional zero set.

## Application

Nodal interfaces partition the interior of a boundary-loaded vibrating medium. The proposed law predicts their total size directly from the boundary spectral frequency.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Counterexample. The source supplies a fixed smooth closed5-manifold and eigenfunctions phi_j whose nodal4-volume exceeds every stated square-root eigenvalue bound. On its product with[-L,L], U=phi_j cosh(sqrt(lambda_j)t) is harmonic with the same outward Steklov eigenvalue sqrt(lambda_j)tanh(Lsqrt(lambda_j)) on both smooth boundary components. Its interior nodal5-volume is2L times the original nodal volume, refuting the universal upper linear Steklov bound in dimension6. No lower-bound resolution is asserted.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-08)

**Known cases:** The two-sided linear interior nodal-length estimate is established for real-analytic Riemannian surfaces.

**Remaining target:** The corresponding two-sided interior nodal-volume estimate for every smooth manifold in every dimension at least two.

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The analytic two-dimensional case is established. The 2024 survey asks for the general smooth estimates. The April 2026 paper improves estimates for boundary nodal sets and does not establish the displayed two-sided interior estimate.

**Search audit:** “Steklov interior nodal volume linear bound conjecture”; “Steklov eigenfunctions nodal 2026”; “smooth Steklov Yau nodal bounds”. Searches included proof, counterexample, and 2025–2026 updates. No later resolution of the stated problem was located; this is a literature review, not a proof of openness.
