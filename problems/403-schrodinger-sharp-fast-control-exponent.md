# 403. Sharp exponential cost of fast boundary quantum control

**Area:** PDE control / Schrödinger dynamics

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-10-15

## Problem statement

Fix $`L>0`$ and consider complex-valued solutions of

```math
iy_t+y_{xx}=0\quad\text{on }(0,T)\times(0,L),\qquad y(t,0)=h(t),\quad y(t,L)=0.
```

Define

```math
C_S(T,L)=\sup_{\|y_0\|_{H^{-1}(0,L)}=1}\inf\{\|h\|_{L^2(0,T)}:y(0)=y_0,\ y(T)=0\},
```

where solutions and boundary values are understood by transposition. Is it true that

```math
\lim_{T\downarrow0}T\log C_S(T,L)=L^2/4?
```

## Application

This coefficient measures the energy penalty for steering a quantum wave in a very short time. Bounds with unspecified exponential constants cannot determine the limiting resource requirement.

## Status review

Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #160](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/160). The norm control cost has liminf T log C_S(T,L) at least L^2/pi, strictly excluding the proposed L^2/4 coefficient.

**Scope:** Full negative answer to the proposed limit; the true sharp coefficient and limit existence remain separate questions.

### Earlier review notes

The following historical notes are retained; the current decision and review date are given above.

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The 2025 source explicitly conjectures the displayed coefficient and improves the upper coefficient to 27^(1/4)/4. Nguyen’s January 2026 preprint arXiv:2601.12810 gives fractional-order cost bounds, not this sharp classical coefficient; its Theorem 1.1 assumes 1/2<s<1. Lissy’s August 2026 arXiv:2608.08041 concerns the heat equation. Searches through 22 September 2026 located no resolution for the Schrödinger assertion.
