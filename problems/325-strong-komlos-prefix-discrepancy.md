# 325. A constant bound for fixed-order prefix discrepancy

**Area:** Discrepancy, cumulative allocation and integer optimization

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-10-15

## Problem statement

Does there exist an absolute constant $`C>0`$ with the following property? For every pair of positive integers $`d,T`$ and every ordered sequence $`v_1,\ldots,v_T\in\mathbb R^d`$ with Euclidean norms $`\|v_i\|_2\le1`$, one can choose signs $`\varepsilon_1,\ldots,\varepsilon_T\in\{-1,1\}`$ such that

```math
\max_{1\le k\le T}
\left\|\sum_{i=1}^{k}\varepsilon_i v_i\right\|_\infty
\le C,
\qquad
\|z\|_\infty=\max_{1\le j\le d}|z_j|?
```

The order is fixed. The signs may depend on the entire sequence, but the same signs must work for every prefix and coordinate. The constant must be independent of $`d`$, $`T`$ and the vectors. This is the strong, or prefix, Komlós conjecture. No online decision rule or efficient algorithm is required. [1, 2]

Taking $`k=T`$ gives only terminal-sum control. Controlling each prefix with a separately chosen signing would not answer the stronger question here.

## Application

View each vector as the feature or resource contributions of one indivisible item in a prescribed sequence. Its sign assigns it to one of two groups. The prefix sums then measure cumulative imbalance at each stage, so the conjecture asks for a uniform buffer independent of the number of items and tracked resources. Equivalently, putting $`x_i=(1+\varepsilon_i)/2`$ rounds a half-allocation to whole items with coordinate error at most $`C/2`$ at every prefix. These are interpretations of the stated model. Prefix discrepancy also feeds into Steinitz rearrangement bounds, which have applications in integer programming and scheduling. [1, §1] An existence result alone would not supply an efficient allocation algorithm.

## Status review

Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). Negative

[Proof or source](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2026/242/download) · [Independent AI review](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-15-active-prs/170-source-scope-review_90_114.md). The linked review records the target comparison.

**Scope:** The source explicitly allows offline signs for each physical column occurrence, fixes the order in advance and defines prefix discrepancy with one common sign assignment. Its stronger offset-robust property P_E(M,a) quantifies over arbitrary starting vectors and coefficients in E. Original columns alter coordinate-pair means only; detector columns alter pair differences only. The nested word lets a post hoc witness choose one child at each depth where a large mean is frozen. The final fixed detector list includes every possible row tuple, so the matching detector traces the original M-path with arbitrary offset. It forces a large tracker at a time when its ancestor mean is still large; max(|h+z|,|h−z|)=|h|+|z| doubles the guarantee. This is not an adaptive change to the submitted sequence. Starting M0=[1] and E={|c|>=1} gives P(M0,1/2); recurrence doubles a and column sparsity, and d_(k+1)=2d_k² yields d_k=2^(2^k−1). Scaling each column by1/sqrt(2^k) gives Euclidean norm1 and discrepancy at least2^(k/2−1), unbounded. With zero offset that positive witness cannot be the empty prefix. Thus the exact main countertheorem needed by AIM325 follows; no efficiency or ordinary terminal-sum claim is substituted.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-18)

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Open in cited literature; no later resolution located as of 2026-09-18. The independently authored source [2, Conjecture 1.6] explicitly retains this question. The September manuscripts [2, 3] claim universal constants for the final sum and explicitly distinguish that result from controlling all prefixes.

For general fixed inputs, [4, Theorem 2] gives an $`O(\sqrt{\log(2T)})`$ prefix bound at fixed positive success probability, with an online algorithm. Its online optimality does not establish an offline lower bound. The smoothed-input theorem and branching-path counterexamples in [1] change, respectively, the input assumptions and the family of constraints.

The constant bounds in [5] require sufficiently small coordinates; their failure estimates can be vacuous without that restriction. Its lower bound concerns online signing, while the signs here may use future vectors. Source [6] permits discarding some terms, which this question forbids.

The [evidence record](../research/expansion-2026-09/candidates/strong-komlos-prefix-discrepancy.json) also compares complex colors, adaptive games, partial colorings and structured flow/assignment rounding at full relevant statement level. Historical results were read through explicit scholarly restatements where noted. Source research and a separated adversarial self-pass examine scope and status, without certifying the complete technical proofs.

A publication refresh on September 18, 2026 rechecked status and upstream duplicates; see the [batch 4 audit](../research/expansion-2026-09/batch-04-review.md). No matching later resolution was located.
