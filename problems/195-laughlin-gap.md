# 195. The bosonic Laughlin contact-interaction gap

**Area:** Fractional quantum Hall physics

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Let $`\mathcal P_N`$ be the symmetric complex polynomials in $`z_1,\ldots,z_N`$ of total degree at most $`N(N-1)`$, with inner product

```math
\langle F,G\rangle=\pi^{-N}\int_{\mathbb C^N}\overline{F(z)}G(z)e^{-\sum_j|z_j|^2}\,dz.
```

On the full polynomial space define the orthogonal projection

```math
(P_{ij}F)(z)=F\left(z_1,\ldots,\frac{z_i+z_j}{2},\ldots,\frac{z_i+z_j}{2},\ldots,z_N\right).
```

The sum $`H_N=\sum_{i<j}P_{ij}`$ preserves $`\mathcal P_N`$. Its kernel contains the Laughlin polynomial $`\prod_{i<j}(z_i-z_j)^2`$. Does there exist $`c>0`$ such that, for every $`N\ge2`$,

```math
\inf\big(\sigma(H_N|_{\mathcal P_N})\setminus\{0\}\big)\ge c?
```

This fixes the contact-interaction normalization and the angular-momentum cutoff while letting particle number grow.

## Application

The gap protects a correlated quantum Hall fluid against low-energy perturbations. The same model describes rapidly rotating ultracold bosons restricted to the lowest Landau level.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Solved on the basis of an **unverified announcement**. The candidate proof explicitly claims the plane inequality H^2>=H/3 on every bosonic particle sector, with coefficient1 for each unordered pair projector. This restricts to the invariant finite polynomial cutoff in the local target and gives positive eigenvalues>=1/3 by spectral calculus. The spherical threshold Q>=3088 in the abstract is not substituted for a plane result; the final plane assertion in Theorem3 is used. No full analytic/certificate audit is asserted.

The complete external proof has not been independently verified here; no new Lean kernel replay, certificate replay or human peer review is asserted. This status records a complete matching claim under the requested policy.

**Review boundary:** Independent review of the analytic reduction and every required exact/interval certificate remains outstanding.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-13)

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The selected case is the full lowest-Landau-level contact interaction, with the degree cutoff used in Rougerie’s conjecture. Results for truncated pseudopotentials or thin-cylinder limits change the Hamiltonian or geometry. The 2024 paper “The charge gap is greater than the neutral gap in fractional quantum Hall systems” (arXiv:2410.11645) explicitly still treats the full pseudopotential gap as open; comparing two gaps does not prove a positive lower bound.

**Search audit:** “Laughlin spectral gap conjecture full contact pseudopotential proof 2025 2026”; “2410.11645 Haldane conjecture neutral gap”. Searches included later proofs, counterexamples, and 2025–2026 updates. No resolution matching the stated hypotheses was located.
