# 412. Sharp vanishing-viscosity control time for downstream transport

**Area:** PDE control / advection–diffusion

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Fix $`L,M>0`$. For $`\varepsilon>0`$, consider

```math
y_t+My_x-\varepsilon y_{xx}=0\quad\text{in }(0,T)\times(0,L),\qquad y(t,0)=h(t),\quad y(t,L)=0,
```

with $`y(0)=y_0\in L^2(0,L)`$, interpreted by transposition for boundary inputs $`h\in L^2(0,T)`$. Define

```math
C(T,\varepsilon)=\sup_{\|y_0\|_2\le1}\inf\{\|h\|_{L^2(0,T)}:y(T)=0\}.
```

Is it true that for every $`T>L/M`$,

```math
\lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow0}C(T,\varepsilon)=0?
```

The actuator is at the inflow endpoint and $`M`$ is strictly positive.

## Application

Advection carries a contaminant or temperature perturbation out of a channel in time L/M. The problem asks whether arbitrarily small diffusion changes that sharp control horizon or requires nonvanishing actuation after the flushing time.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Solved on the basis of an **unverified announcement**. Negative for T between L/M and2L/M.

[Claimed solution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2609.35355v1) · [Dated statement comparison](../research/solution-status-audit-2026-11-03/lane-b/412.json). Source locator: Definition cost(2); Theorem1.3 positive speed; scaling(22); Theorem7.1. The comparison records the hypotheses, quantifiers and any reduction to the original target. The full external proof has not been independently verified here; no new Lean kernel replay, certificate replay or human peer review is asserted.

### Earlier status record


Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). Claim: negative, claimed

[Proof or source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2609.35355v1) · [Independent AI review](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-15-active-prs/170-source-scope-review_115_140.md). The linked review records the exact scope and verification limits; this is not human peer review or Lean verification.

**Review boundary:** Independent review of the complete external proof remains outstanding.

### Earlier status review (2026-09-22)

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

The negative-velocity part of the original Coron–Guerrero conjecture has been disproved and is deliberately absent from this formulation. The 2023 treatment still records a gap between the positive-velocity lower and upper times. Searches through 22 September 2026 found no matching resolution for T>L/M; Lissy’s August 2026 arXiv:2608.08041 establishes a heat-control cost coefficient, not the displayed transport limit.
