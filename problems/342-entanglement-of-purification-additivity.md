# 342. Additivity of entanglement of purification

**Area:** Quantum information and correlation preparation

**Status:** ✅ SOLVED

**Last checked:** 2026-11-03

## Problem statement

Let $`A,B,C,D`$ be arbitrary finite-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces. A density operator is a positive semidefinite operator of trace one. For a density operator $`\rho_{AB}`$, define its entanglement of purification by

```math
E_P(A:B)_\rho=
\min_{A',B',\,\psi}
S\!\left(\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}\nolimits_{BB'}|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\right),
\qquad
\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}\nolimits_{A'B'}|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|=\rho_{AB}.
```

The minimum ranges over finite-dimensional auxiliary spaces $`A',B'`$ and unit vectors $`\psi`$ on $`A\otimes A'\otimes B\otimes B'`$. Here $`\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}\nolimits`$ with subsystem subscripts denotes partial trace, and

```math
S(\tau)=-\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}\nolimits(\tau\log_2\tau),\qquad 0\log_2 0=0,
```

is the von Neumann entropy. The minimum is attained; no particular purification or auxiliary dimension is prescribed in the optimization.

For every pair of density operators $`\rho_{AB}`$ and $`\sigma_{CD}`$, is

```math
E_P(AC:BD)_{\rho\otimes\sigma}
=E_P(A:B)_\rho+E_P(C:D)_\sigma?
```

The left-hand side groups $`A,C`$ with one party and $`B,D`$ with the other, and allows arbitrary joint purifications. Products of separate minimizing purifications give the $`\le`$ direction. The question is whether strict inequality ever occurs. It concerns the ordinary von Neumann entropy and includes all mixed states; classical states and identical factors are special cases of this one question.

## Application

Two separated laboratories can prepare many copies of a correlated state using shared maximally entangled qubit pairs, local operations and a communication rate tending to zero. The optimal asymptotic number of pairs consumed per copy is

```math
E_P^\infty(A:B)_\rho
=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}E_P(A^n:B^n)_{\rho^{\otimes n}}.
```

This is a cost for creating both classical and quantum correlations. General additivity would identify it with the one-copy quantity $`E_P`$. A rigorous counterexample would show that optimizing preparations jointly can save resources relative to separate purifications. The operational result concerns vanishing communication rate, with preparation error tending to zero.

## Status review

**Resolution update (3 November 2026):** Solved on the basis of an **unverified announcement**. Negative: ordinary von Neumann entanglement of purification is nonadditive.

[Claimed solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.29539v1) · [Dated statement comparison](../research/solution-status-audit-2026-11-03/lane-b/342.json). Source locator: Theorem1; §2; AppendixA.1 ancilla reduction; §3 exact lower-bound certificate. The comparison records the hypotheses, quantifiers and any reduction to the original target. The full external proof has not been independently verified here; no new Lean kernel replay, certificate replay or human peer review is asserted.

### Earlier status record


Reviewed 15 October 2026 against the original target in [PR #170](https://github.com/MColbrook/AIM/pull/170). Claim: nonadditivity claim with exact finite artifact replay; complete analytic reduction awaiting independent review.

[Proof or source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.29539v1) · [Independent AI review](../research/solution_reviews/2026-10-15-active-prs/170-source-scope-root.md). The linked review records the exact scope and verification limits; this is not human peer review or Lean verification.

**Review boundary:** Independent review of the complete external argument remains outstanding; the source claims the full target and no specific mathematical gap was established by this applicability audit.

**Literature check:** Open in cited literature; no later resolution located.

Chen–Winter explicitly formulate the general question and give strong numerical evidence against additivity for two-qubit Werner states. Their Theorem 3 proves a convexity property of the regularized quantity minus entropy. The numerical minimization supplies feasible upper bounds; the missing rigorous lower bound for the one-copy optimum is acknowledged in §IV. Their title therefore does not constitute a rigorous counterexample to the displayed equality. Bagchi–Pati prove the general upper-bound direction and retain the strict-inequality question.

The August 2026 Negari–Baghali Khanian preprint explicitly retains the von Neumann problem. Its analytic counterexamples apply to Rényi orders $`0\le\alpha<1`$. Appendix C.2 explains why the construction does not pass uniformly to $`\alpha=1`$. Its additivity theorem concerns $`\alpha\ge2`$ and a classical two-qubit factor. Its exact one-copy formula for classical two-qubit states does not solve the joint optimization for their tensor products. Faraji–Baghali Khanian prove order-two results for specified channel families; §V leaves the Werner-state channel reformulation unresolved. These results do not decide the general von Neumann equality.

The September 19 searches covered proofs, disproofs, numerical certificates, tensor-product formulations, author and citation chains, unrestricted dates, 2024–2026 results, and revisions or corrections. The cited full-text locations were read. ArXiv histories and author publication pages were checked; publisher texts were not line-compared. A separated adversarial self-pass passed on September 19; no independent agent or human review occurred. The [evidence ledger](../research/expansion-2026-09/candidates/entanglement-of-purification-additivity.json) records the exact comparisons and the distinction from the catalogue's [amplitude-damping additivity question](207-amplitude-damping-additivity.md), [quantum entropy cone](035-quantum-entropy-cone.md) and [NPT bound entanglement](032-npt-bound-entanglement.md).
